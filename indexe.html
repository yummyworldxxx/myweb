<li class="k">■Three Secret Rules for Enjoying Hot Pot Deliciously</li>
<li class="k">① Green onion, cabbage (or Chinese cabbage), and tofu are the holy trinity. Simple, essential, and the best combo. Bad meat can ruin the taste—try it once without meat first.</li>
<li class="k">② Smaller ingredients taste better. Try cutting them a bit finer.</li>
<li class="k">③ When eating, put down your phone and turn off the TV. Focus on the food and relax. Eating alone is highly recommended too.</li>

<li class="p">Seriously damn delicious!!!<br>
I would highly recommend this to my past self. The best spicy flavor so far.<br>
The super simple combo of green onion, cabbage, and tofu is perfect. Chinese cabbage works as a substitute for cabbage.<br>
If you add about 30 yen worth of yakisoba noodles, somehow it turns into ramen and tastes insanely good.</li>

<li class="p">Tasty.<br>
I can recommend this to my past self.<br>
A comforting flavor. Recommended when feeling down.<br>
A reassuring taste. Makes me want to buy it again.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good.<br>
I think it tastes better without adding raw egg.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good.<br>
The ratio of soup base to water is 1:2.<br>
The base contains 300ml, and you add 600ml water, so you get a large 900ml serving.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good.<br>
It said “No.1” on it, but it’s Pretty good, nothing more.</li>

<li class="p">astes great when eaten as oil noodles.<br>
Using the best method, it scores 4.0.<br>
Really delicious.<br>
The best way is to cut green onions, add 50ml of liquid and 100ml water, then add yakisoba noodles and Wait until all the soup has evaporated.<br>
As a hot pot, it’s Pretty good.</li>

<li class="p">The worst ever.<br>
The smell is unbearable.<br>
It kills the appetite.<br>
The smell even comes back when eating hot pot.<br>
The end.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good.<br>
The rice porridge might reach 4.0 next time I try it.<br>
Needs further review.<br>
I haven’t tried adding pork belly yet, so I might buy it again.</li>

<li class="p">This might be a hit.<br>
I’ll order again.<br>
Needs further review.<br>
It was rated 3.5, but might be 4.0 next time.<br>
Definitely felt the vegetables were tasty!</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good.</li>

<li class="p">Not tasty.<br>
The smell is also bad.<br>
The cubes themselves might be bad.</li>

<li class="p">pretty good. Adding udon noodles makes the flavor strange. The clear soup becomes cloudy. The package’s back recommends ochazuke, so udon doesn't seem to be a good match.</li>
<li class="p">It's pretty good. The ramen with yakisoba added might be rated 4.0. Under review.</li>

<li class="p">
Such a mysterious product. At first, no matter how many bites I take, it’s a 3.0.  
But when I add green onion and tofu to the hot pot soup base and finish the whole thing, I’m like, “Huh? Wait… this is a 3.5.” Then, “Hmm… I might actually buy this again.”  
Usually with hot pot soup bases, there’s a moment when they give off an unpleasant taste, but with this one, there’s absolutely none of that. Amazing. Seriously, that’s impressive.  
There really aren’t products like this. It’s almost like it’s asking me, “Is your sense of taste okay? You always go for strong flavors, but can you appreciate mine?”  
Feels like it’s throwing me a challenge. Such an interesting product.
</li>

<li class="p">normal.</li>

<li class="p">
good. Could very well be a 4.0. Definitely close to 4.0. Whether it’s truly a 4.0 (something I can recommend to my past self and would want to eat again) is still under review. I’ll probably buy this again. The rice porridge was also tasty. There’s a huge gap between 3.5 (tasty, nothing special) and 4.0 (want to eat again), and this might just cross that line. For now, I’ll give it a 3.5.
</li>


<li class="p">
When I put tofu and green onion in the hot pot, it was super tasty!! 4.0 (The hot pot with tofu only is already a 4.0, but adding green onion makes it an even better 4.0). The rice porridge with tofu, green onion, egg, and rice is also 4.0. So good!!! I’ll definitely make that porridge again. The ramen with yakisoba noodles was 3.5. It was tasty, but maybe the yakisoba noodles didn’t match well.
</li>

<li class="p">
Seriously, insanely delicious!!! Pure genius.<br>
I could totally recommend this to my past self. Love that it comes in small packs.<br>
Super simple, but green onion × tofu is the best. So good!! Absolutely amazing.
udon and yakisoba is good.※5 spicy degree
</li>


<li class="p">
This is the ultimate way to cook it. No need to bother washing a frying pan—just use a small pot.  
Pour in oil (a decent amount, not too little—better a bit more). Then throw in the seafood.  
Be sure to cover it with a lid and let it gently cook/steam.  
After that, add 300 ml of water, bring it to a boil, add the seasoning powder, bring to a boil again, then add the noodles and eat in 2 minutes.  
Champon × My Ingredients × My Cooking Style = ★★★★ (4.0).  
The key is the amount of oil and the steaming. When I used way less oil, it wasn’t as good as the ultimate method.  
Seriously delicious!! Tastes like it could end wars!!! The soup is amazing. I’ll keep an eye on Itsuki Foods.
