<li class="p">Fist-sized Hamburger Steak (250g) (Sawayaka - Senagawa Branch lunchtime)
Served with onion sauce and regular-sized rice — see rating on the right</li>

<li class="p">★★★★ (4.0)</li>

<li class="p">2-39-37 Senagawa, Aoi Ward, Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan</li>

<li class="p">First time at Sawayaka!! I was blown away. Seriously delicious. Way better than I expected. This is honestly amazing. Could’ve even given it a 4.5. ※It was so good, I went to a different branch later... but that one wasn’t great. So yeah, the grilling matters *a lot*. If I were the owner of Sawayaka, I’d totally standardize the grill quality. (Do more research to perfect the cooking and ensure consistency across all staff.) The grilling skill varies too much. The Senagawa branch was great, but the other one wasn’t. If the grilling had been spot-on, I might’ve rated it 4.5. If they could consistently grill it right, I’d honestly wanna live in that area lol. Big shoutout to Sawayaka!!!! It’s seriously awesome. By the way, since 25/7/25, I’ve only been to Sawayaka twice—Senagawa and that other place. I wanna try more items too!!!! Also, Shizuoka is just such a great place!!!!!!!</li>

<li class="p">I ate it on 25/7/26. ※As of 25/7/25, I started counting only meals rated 4.0 or higher.</li>
