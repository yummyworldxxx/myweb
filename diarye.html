<li class="p">Delicious. A comforting flavor.</li>
<li class="p">Added tofu — it was delicious.<br>Soothing taste. Might be the best in this genre.</li>

<li class="p">Akakara is seriously tasty.</li>

<li class="p">Add yakisoba and it becomes ramen. Tasty.</li>

<li class="p">Ate it as leftover vegetable soup.</li>

<li class="p">Better without raw egg. Adding egg softens the spiciness. Kept it simple with tofu and green onion. Just plain good.</li>

<li class="p">Thought I used 100ml of soup base, but maybe it was only 50ml.  
Ate kimchi hotpot from 5/16 to 5/22, but the numbers don't add up lol.  
Since it's 1:2 with water, 300ml of soup base makes 900ml total (base 300 + water 600).</li>

<li class="p">Ate it twice, in the evening and at night. Added yakisoba at night.  
Was on a phone call while eating, so couldn't focus on the taste.  
Yeah, gotta focus when eating.</li>

<li class="p">Added cabbage and green onion. Ate it as soup.  
Didn't cook rice — tragic.  
Hotpot should definitely be eaten with rice.  
Obviously. No rice = game over...</li>

<li class="p">Just added tofu. Pretty tasty.  
If it's just tofu, no need for cutting board or knife.  
So easy. Break the tofu with chopsticks.</li>

<li class="p">Added tofu and yakisoba to make ramen.  
30-yen yakisoba turns into ramen. Pretty good.  
No cutting board or knife needed — broke tofu with chopsticks.  
Super easy.</li>

<li class="p">Just plain good. Doesn't quite feel like No.1 though.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good. Better than Ebara (kimchi hotpot) with yakisoba.</li>

<li class="p">Not bad at all.</li>

<li class="p">So damn good. Seriously delicious — like abura soba from a shop.  
Green onion × yakisoba is all you need.  
Green onion alone is insanely tasty. With yakisoba = super win.  
Haven’t had something this good in a while. Solid 4.0. Want it again.  
Also, the noodles are great.  
Key point: heat until all the soup is gone.</li>

<li class="p">Pretty good. Feels like ramen.  
If the soup remains, it's ramen.</li>

<li class="p">Not bad at all.</li>

<li class="p">4.0 — Got it!!! Eureka!!  
Heat it until all the soup is gone = insanely good 4.0.  
If soup remains, it's ramen = 3.5.</li>

<li class="p">Ate it as hotpot. Just plain good.</li>

<li class="p">Ate it late at night. Smell was awful. Got dragged in by a terrible smell.  
Worst. 1.0. Disgusting.  
Made zosui (rice porridge) for the first time.  
Started as 3.5 — “Hey, not bad?”  
Then gradually dropped to 2.0.  
Never want to eat this again.  
This was terrible. Smell really is critical.</li>

<li class="p">It was insanely delicious — 4.0.  
Wrote "Godly" in my notes.  
(Mistake: Poured 500ml into a new PET bottle → next day noticed the error.  
It changed the flavor. Something tasted off.)</li>

<li class="p">3.0. Feels worse than yesterday. Something’s off.  
Maybe because I left it in a PET bottle in a hot room.  
Tastes bad. Definitely off.</li>

<li class="p">The taste really has dropped.  
Even though I boiled it properly. Hmm...  
Something feels wrong.</li>

<li class="p">Felt kinda heavy.</li>

<li class="p">Hotpot was 3.5. Made zosui afterward — 3.5 with egg.  
Maybe next time it'll be 4.0.</li>

<li class="p">Hotpot is 3.5.  
When I added yakisoba, it felt heavy — 3.0.  
The very first time I tried yakisoba with it, it was 4.0 though.  
Not sure why the difference.</li>

<li class="p">Delicious. As expected.</li>

<li class="p">4.5. This is good!!  
Adding udon makes it even better!!!  
Seriously delicious.</li>

<li class="p">Tasty — 3.5.  
Maybe even 4.0 level.  
The vegetables are great!  
Just like the packaging says — the veggies shine.</li>

<li class="p">Added extra tofu. Tasty.  
Tofu’s really good.  
Might even be a 4.0.</li>

<li class="p">Just plain good — 3.5.  
Up to the tofu and Chinese cabbage, it was good.  
Then added old chicken = tasted awful.  
Rotten chicken = never again.  
Also, Chinese cabbage core = awful.  
Lesson learned.</li>

<li class="p">Not tasty. Weird smell too. Might be the cube itself that tastes bad.</li>

<li class="p">pretty good. Adding udon changes the flavor in a bad way, so it's better not to add it. I'd like to try it as ochazuke next time — the back of the package recommends it. Udon doesn't seem to be welcome.</li>
<li class="p">It's pretty good. The ramen with yakisoba added might be rated 4.0. Under review.</li>
<li class="p">I made it on 8/3 and ate it on 8/5 — the flavor had totally changed (probably because I chilled it and left it out. Oh my god, I learned my lesson.)</li>

<li class="p">Such a mysterious product. At first, no matter how many bites I take, I think, “Yeah, this is a 3.0.”  
But when I add green onion and tofu to the hot pot soup base and eat the whole thing, I’m like, “Huh? Wait… this is actually a 3.5.” Then, “Hmm… I might actually buy this again.”  
Usually with hot pot soup bases, there’s a moment when they give off an unpleasant taste, but with this one, there’s absolutely none of that. Amazing. Seriously, that’s impressive.  
I ended up finishing the entire thing in one meal. Maybe eating it with just tofu and green onion is a stroke of genius. Somehow, I could just keep eating until the end.  
There really aren’t many products like this. It’s almost like it’s asking me, “Is your sense of taste okay? You always go for strong flavors, but can you appreciate mine?”  
It feels like a kind of challenge. Honestly, I’ll probably buy it again. The fact that it never gets tiring to eat is insane — that’s seriously impressive.  
It might also be amazing when you’ve got a cold. And it feels like something you could eat every day without getting tired of it.  
Plus, eating it somehow makes me feel naturally energized.  
I ended up eating the whole thing… and it’s rare for me to finish everything in one sitting.</li>


<li class="p">normal.</li>
<li class="p">not tasty</li>

<li class="p">Delicious. Both the hot pot and the rice porridge could easily be a 4.0. Definitely close to a 4.0. Still reviewing whether it’s truly a 4.0 (something I could recommend to my past self and want to eat again). I’ll probably buy it again. The gap between “just tasty” (3.5) and “want to eat again” (4.0) is huge, but this might be crossing that line. For now, marking it as 3.5.</li>
<li class="p">The udon is simply tasty too.</li>

<li class="p">It tastes pretty good, but maybe the small packs are not as good as the big one.  There’s also a theory that it just didn’t go well with the yakisoba noodles.</li>

<li class="p">Just tofu was delicious. 4.0. I want to eat it again. I didn’t cut the tofu on a cutting board, but broke it with chopsticks—made cooking easy. A genius idea. The rice porridge was also tasty. About 3.5, but still at the level where I’d want to eat it again (I kind of crave that porridge again).<br>
But for now, I’ll give it 3.5. I made the soup a bit too little, then added egg and rice. Next time I should leave more broth. I drank too much of it, lol.</li>


<li class="p">
Since I was talking with someone while eating, I couldn’t really focus on the taste. But it was pretty good.  
</li>

<li class="p">
Pretty good. Ate the leftover from the hot pot (one pack portion) on 25/8/30.  
</li>

<li class="p">
Delicious!!! Feels like happiness. Tofu and green onions are really tasty—solid 4.0. I want to eat it again. The tofu and green onion rice porridge is seriously amazing too, also a 4.0!! (Whisk the egg properly, add rice, and heat the pot while stirring with cooking chopsticks—it makes it even better, prevents burning, and makes cleaning easier.) Both the hot pot and the porridge are something I can confidently recommend to my past self. I’ll definitely buy this again. Tofu and green onion is a hit!!!
</li>


<li class="p">
  Seriously insanely delicious!! Pure genius.<br>
  I could totally recommend this to my past self. The small packs are great too, very convenient.<br>
  Super simple with just green onion and tofu — absolutely amazing!! A total beast.
