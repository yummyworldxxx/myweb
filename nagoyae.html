<li class="p">The most insanely delicious okonomiyaki in the world!!!!!<br>
GOD!!! Genius!!! The seafood flavor is just amazing. Is there even a better okonomiyaki out there? Freaking delicious, seriously.
Starting from 25/7/25, I began counting meals in Nagoya that score 4.0 or higher — so this is the first official one. But honestly, how many times have I eaten this DX okonomiyaki in the past? Probably a ton.
It's SO GOOD!!!! Marry me!!!!!!! Honestly, it could even be a 5.0. It's just that good. I always crave DX Okonomiyaki again and again.
It makes me fall in love over and over. Seriously delicious. Aahhh I wanna eat it again. That seafood flavor though (yes, again...) I don’t know why, but I’m in love!!!!</li>

<li class="p">Delicious. But I think it used to be around a 4.5 level before. Hmm, today it’s more like a 4.0. Still, I’ll eat it again. The quality wasn’t that great today, but even so, it’s definitely over 4.0.</li>
<li class="p">Delicious! 4.5. It was really good. My order didn’t go through at first, but oh well — it happens sometimes.</li>
