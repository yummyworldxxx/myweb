GOD!!! Genius!!! The seafood flavor is just amazing. Is there even a better okonomiyaki out there? Freaking delicious, seriously.
Starting from 25/7/25, I began counting meals in Nagoya that score 4.0 or higher — so this is the first official one. But honestly, how many times have I eaten this DX okonomiyaki in the past? Probably a ton.
It's SO GOOD!!!! Marry me!!!!!!! Honestly, it could even be a 5.0. It's just that good. I always crave DX Okonomiyaki again and again.
It makes me fall in love over and over. Seriously delicious. Aahhh I wanna eat it again. That seafood flavor though (yes, again...) I don’t know why, but I’m in love!!!!</li>
