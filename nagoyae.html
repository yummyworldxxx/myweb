<li class="p">Eaten with spicy sauce × mayonnaise(How you eat it really matters) </li>
<li class="p">*First, try it on its own to appreciate the flavor.</li>
<li class="p">Eat it on its own. The flavors won’t get mixed with other dishes, so I only order this one. Also, don’t order a large portion.</li>
<li class="p">① Always eat it inside the restaurant right after ordering, while it’s still hot — I realized this is super important. ② Eat it on its own so the flavors don’t get mixed with other dishes. The combo of ① and ② is key. *If you take it to go, it’s only a 3.5.</li>

<li class="p">The most insanely delicious okonomiyaki in the world!!!!!<br>
GOD!!! Genius!!! The seafood flavor is just amazing. Is there even a better okonomiyaki out there? Freaking delicious, seriously.
Starting from 25/7/25, I began counting meals in Nagoya that score 4.0 or higher — so this is the first official one. But honestly, how many times have I eaten this DX okonomiyaki in the past? Probably a ton.
It's SO GOOD!!!! Marry me!!!!!!! Honestly, it could even be a 5.0. It's just that good. I always crave DX Okonomiyaki again and again.
It makes me fall in love over and over. Seriously delicious. Aahhh I wanna eat it again. That seafood flavor though (yes, again...) I don’t know why, but I’m in love!!!!</li>

<li class="p">Delicious. But I think it used to be around a 4.5 level before. Hmm, today it’s more like a 4.0. Still, I’ll eat it again. The quality wasn’t that great today, but even so, it’s definitely over 4.0.</li>
<li class="p">Delicious! 4.5. It was really good. My order didn’t go through at first, but oh well — it happens sometimes.</li>

<li class="p">Damn, this is good! Was the cheeseburger always this tasty? I got it — Eureka! Cheeseburger alone × eat it right away in the restaurant = that’s why it’s a 4.0. When it’s takeout or Uber, it’s only a 3.5. I see now — the best way is to eat it right there, on its own, totally focused. It was hot and insanely good. 4.0. I wasn’t even planning to feature a chain on Yummy, but this was shockingly delicious. Seriously, how you eat it makes all the difference. The way you eat is everything. Takeout just isn’t the same — the taste changes that much. Eating it solo, inside, fully focused — that’s when it’s amazing. If you’re on your phone while eating, it’s game over. Put the phone away!!! 😂 Just having it on the table ruins the taste. Man, that was incredible. I want to eat it again!!</li>
