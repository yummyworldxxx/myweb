# Welcome to Super Project "Yummy"

Yummy is a Cosmos Impact Web Service.

It aims to solve issues related to eating.  
First, I focus on solving problems related to NABE (Japanese hot pot).  
NABE is easy to cook and delicious, but we don’t always know what makes NABE truly "Yummy."  
This web service helps you understand that.
