# 🚀 Welcome to Cosmos Project "Yummy" 🚀

**Yummy** is a Cosmos Impact Web Service.

It aims to solve issues related to eating.  
To start, I focus on solving problems related to **NABE** (Japanese hot pot).

NABE is easy to cook and delicious,  
but we don’t always know what makes NABE truly "Yummy."  
This web service helps you understand that.

## 🍲 What is NABE?

**NABE** is a Japanese-style hot pot dish where various ingredients—like vegetables, meat, tofu, and noodles—are cooked together in a shared pot.  
It’s commonly enjoyed in winter and during gatherings.

But I eat it in summer too. Why not? 😎🍲
