Yeoh——!! The okonomiyaki I had yesterday, 26/1/3, at Nanjamonja (Nagoya City, near Shiogamaguchi Station) was insanely good. It’s been a full day and I’m still moved by it.
One of the reasons I created Yummy is that *how* and *what* you eat is absolutely crucial to how good something tastes. Without that, there’s no reproducibility, and the emotion doesn’t come across.
You can’t share the same level of “this is amazing.” And even at the same restaurant, what you order changes everything. Like how the soy-sauce ramen can be incredible, but the salt version is just okay.
In this case, adding spicy sauce and mayonnaise to the deluxe okonomiyaki brings out every single element of what makes okonomiyaki delicious.
Honestly, part of me thinks it could’ve been a 5.0. Haha. It was really that good.
Man, it was amazing. That feeling—pure emotion.

Insanely delicious. A monster. Even a divine 5.0 rating would be fair. Seriously, this is god-tier.  
I wonder how many times I’ve been here. Eating the Deluxe Okonomiyaki with spicy sauce and mayonnaise  
is a 5.0. Divine. Too delicious. And the extra-spicy Yakisoba is truly amazing. Too good. And the surprising  
Jaga Butter. A dish that surpasses Jaga Butter itself.  
The Deluxe Okonomiyaki was so good that I ordered another one at the end. The flavor of the broth, or rather,  
the seafood taste, is incredible. The world’s best okonomiyaki. If there’s something better, please let me know.  
We ate as a pair.  
Absolutely amazing. I might rate it 5.0, but I’ll stick with 4.5.  
100% going again. I’ve been coming here forever.  
And seriously, the spicy sauce and mayonnaise are essential.<br>

I had doria at Cocos on 1/2 (2026), and yeah—it's seriously good.
If you look at the doria section below, you can tell how different the photos of Cocos’ doria are between 12/2/25 and 1/2/26 lol.
It’s probably the amount of sauce. Even so, I honestly think Cocos’ doria is insanely delicious.
I really wish they’d just give us the recipe.
I want to make it at home.
At this point, I’m basically a Cocos master lol.
But hey—more masters, step up!!

It was seriously delicious. It tastes like happiness. How good was it? So good that it made me want to try making doria at home.
Compared to when I ate doria at Cocos on 25/12/2, it felt like this one had more sauce. If you compare the photos, you can probably see the difference. That might be one reason why it was so good.<br>

I didn’t buy it myself, and I didn’t cook anything either, but the seafood bowl I ate on 1/1 and 1/2 was really good.
It was made by putting sashimi—octopus, salmon, sea bream, bonito, etc.—bought from Lopia (the supermarket run by Katopan’s husband) on vinegared rice.

For some reason, it felt tastier than sashimi from an ordinary supermarket.
I once heard from a high school student who works part-time at Lopia that their fish is good, and yeah… that was legit.

If I remember correctly, Lopia originally started as a butcher shop, so I’d heard rumors that their meat is good—but honestly, their sashimi is great too.
It’s a supermarket that really makes you curious.
