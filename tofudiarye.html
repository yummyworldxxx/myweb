<li class="p">Really delicious!!! It's great to put it on rice and eat!!<br>Also, cooking it in a small pot worked well. (The official method uses a frying pan and adds pork belly, but I didn't use pork belly or a frying pan. Cleanup is easier.)<br>I can recommend it to my past self. Will buy again.</li>

<li class="p">So good! Eating it over rice is amazing!!<br>And you can make it in a small pot. Bring the soup to a boil, add tofu, and it’s ready in 5 minutes. You know, I used half of a 350g block of tofu (175g), but I think using the whole 350g would be fine. (The package has one bag for two servings, and the official recipe says to use 175g of tofu, but I think using a whole 350g block is fine. I’ll try it next time.)</li>


<li class="p">First time_Using 2 servings (The base is for 2 servings × 2 times. I used 1 portion, i.e., 2 servings.)</li>
<li class="p">Second time – used two servings (the soup base comes in two portions of two servings each; this time I used one portion, which is two servings) – used up all of the soup base (one portion finished).</li>
